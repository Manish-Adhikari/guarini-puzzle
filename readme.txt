Guarini's puzzle:

Here i've done the simple representation of solution of Gaurini's puzzle.

There are four knights on 3*3 chessboard:

The two white knights (represented as 2 in array(a)) are at the two bottom corners, and the two black knights (represented as 1 in array (a)) .

i.e array a is

    1  0  1
    0  0  0
    2  0  2

The goal is to switch minimum number of moves such that the white knights(2) are at the upper corners and the black knights are at the bottom corners.

i.e  solution
   
    2  0  2
    0  0  0
    1  0  1

The solution is obtained in 16 steps.

Note: Knight always moves in 'L' path.
